This repository contains a web-based conversation chatbot built using Streamlit, OpenAI's UI, LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Chroma DB as the vector database. The chatbot is designed to engage users in meaningful conversations and provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Features
Web Interface: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
OpenAI UI: Utilizes OpenAI's advanced language model for generating responses.
LangChain: Manages and links various natural language processing (NLP) components.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances response accuracy by retrieving relevant information from the database before generating a response.
Chroma DB: Efficiently stores and retrieves vectorized data to support the RAG mechanism.


How It Works
User Interaction: The user interacts with the chatbot through the Streamlit web interface.
Query Processing: The user's query is processed using LangChain to determine the appropriate NLP components.
Information Retrieval: RAG mechanism queries Chroma DB to retrieve relevant information based on the user's input.
Response Generation: OpenAI's language model generates a response using the retrieved information for enhanced accuracy and relevance.
Response Display: The generated response is displayed on the Streamlit interface for the user.
